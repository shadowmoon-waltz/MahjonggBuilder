MahjonggBuilder was an old googlecode project for Android
Archived and retrieved from: https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/http://mahjonggbuilder.googlecode.com/svn//directory/
Removed old eclipse build files and replaced with gradle build (gradle files based on those in opennotescanner)
It is built with gradle 6.6.1 (that is the wrapper version) with android gradle build tools 4.0.1
increased target api version, but min api version is the same
had to disable lint on release to build, because that was causing the gradle build to crash
Increased version to 1.5
For signing, add "SIGN_PROPS=C:\\somewhere\\mykey.properties" to a local.properties file in the repo root (create if necessary)
That file should be of the form
"
keystore=C:\\somewhere\\key.jks
keystore.password=<keystore password>
keystore.alias=<key alias>
keystore.alias.password=<key password>
"
change sidewall size calculation in BaseActivity.java's updateZBuffer
add preference for sidewall size (marked border size is based on this value) and add preference getter in Utils.java

run "gradlew clean" in repo root to clean up compiled stuff
to build, follow signing notes above if you want automatic signing during build and then run "gradlew assembleRelease" in repo root
apk written to app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk in repo root
